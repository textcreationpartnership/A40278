            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>A TESTIMONY, Of what we believe of CHRIST, before he was manifest in the Flesh; and of his birth and preaching, and what he saith he is himselfe: as also of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, death, resurrection, and ascension. Both as he was GOD and as he was Man.</p>

            <p>But all such by-names, which are not found in the Scriptures we testify against though contended for by such, as say, they have not the same holy Ghost, that gave forth the Scriptures: and it is the same Spirit that gives Christ those by-names, that in Scorn calls us QUAKERS.</p>
            <p>Also how the believers in the primitive times, and now; did and do possess, and enjoy CHRIST JESUS: and what is the Saints Food, and how they are to walke.</p>
            <p>And wherein <hi>they may see what a true Christians</hi> duty is.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isai.</hi> 7: 14.</note>
               <hi>and shall bear a Son, and they shall call his name</hi> IMMANUEL, <hi>which is by interpretation</hi> GOD with us. And when JESUS was born in Bethlehem, it troubled Herod and all Jerusalem, which was the highest place of worship, though they could tell by the Scripture where he was to be born; as in <hi>Micah</hi> 5: 2. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 2: 1, 2, 3, 4. and in <hi>Luke</hi> 1. the Angel of the LORD appeared to Mary, and said unto her <hi>Fear not Mary, for thou hast found favour with GOD; for lo, thou shalt conceive
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44863:3"/>in thy womb and bear a Son, and thou shalt call his name</hi> JESUS, <hi>he shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his Father David, he shall reigne over the house of Iacob forever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then said Mary to the Angel, how shall this be, seing I know not man? And the Angel answered and said unto her, the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the most High shall over shaddow thee, therefor also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>Luke</hi> 2: <hi>Vnto you is born this day in a city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the LORD: and she brought forth her first begotten, and wrapt him in a swadling cloath, and laid him in a manger, becaus there was no roome for them in the inn.</hi> And there the shepherds found him swaddled, lieing in a manger.</p>
            <p>A poor entertainment for the Saviour of the world, and King of kings, and Lord of lords, like the professors now in their highest place of worship, who slight him, as the Jewes did in theirs.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Simeon</hi> that just man, that feared God, a revelation was given him of the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death before had seen the Lord Christ, which came to passe. For he said <hi>Mine eyes have seen thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people, a Light to be revealed to the Gentils, and the glory of thy people Israel:</hi> and this we are witnesses of, and beare witness to, which he saw before his death.</p>
            <p>Now here he knew the Lords Christ by revelation, (which every one must see him by, before their death) who was the Son of God.</p>
            <p>And Christ saith himself <hi>Luke</hi> 10: 21, 22. <hi>I confesse unto thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and learned, and hast revealed them to Babes, even so Father becaus it so pleased thee. Then he turned to his Disciples, and said, All things are given unto me of my Father, and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father, neither who the Father is save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he turned to his Disciples, and said secretly to them, Blessed are the eyes, which see that which you see.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so it is clear here by Christs own words and doctrine, all the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wise, that deny <hi>Revelation</hi> now adays, you know not the Father nor the Son, for Christ saith <hi>no man knoweth the Son, nor the Father, but he to whom</hi> Christ the Son of God <hi>will reveal him:</hi> and as the Apostle Paul
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44863:3"/>saith in another place, that it <hi>pleased the Father to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him;</hi> so blessed be God the Father who hath revealed his Son <hi>in us,</hi> that we might know him and preach him.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, the same was in the beginning with God, and all things were made by it, and without it was made nothing that was made, and in it</hi> (to wit the Word) <hi>was life, and the life was the light of men: and the Light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not, and that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, he was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</hi> They must know him by revelation, for the world by their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom knew him not, nor knoweth God, <hi>he came to his own, and his own received him not, but as many as received him, to them he gave power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this we witness, <hi>And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw the glory thereof, as the glory of the onely begotten Son of the Father, full of Grace and truth, and of his fulness have we received, grace for grace. The Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth by Iesus Christ.</hi> And this <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> we witness, which is our Teacher, and brings our Salvation, and establisheth our hearts. And this is the Prophet like unto Moses, that God hath raised up, whom we do <hi>heare</hi> and <hi>see,</hi> as <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> did, and have seen the heavens open, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God, who was persecuted by the Priests and profess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jewes: <hi>Acts</hi> 7. and this is Christ the Rock that followed the Jewes in the wildeerness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10: 4. And this is the Christ Jesus that <hi>Wrought signes and miracles</hi> amongst the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the great Professors of the <hi>Letter;</hi> that the chief Priests bought of <hi>Iudas for thirty pieces of silver:</hi> whom they scourged and mocked and crucified, and said he had a devil, and by the prince of devils cast out devils: and when they had crucified him, the chief Priests gave large money to the souldiers, to say that <hi>his Disciples had stoln him away by night,</hi> whom they had crucified without the gates at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who appeared to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and to his Disciples; and came amongst them when the doores were shut <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. <hi>And Ioseph of Arimathea a Disciple of Iesus, after they had crucified Christ, he begged his body, and he laid him in a garden in his own new tomb,</hi> Matth. 27. <hi>Now this Iesus is risen the same that they crucified, whom the high Priests and rulers delivered to be condemned to death, and they crucified him,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44863:4"/>Luke 24: 20. who said <hi>behold my hands and feet, for it is I my self, handle me, for a Spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have,</hi> ver. 39. And this was after he was risen from the dead: and Christ Jesus saith after his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20: 21. <hi>As my Father sent me I send you,</hi> his ministers and his Disciples, whom the great letter-professors persecuted, as may be seen in the <hi>Acts:</hi> and still they do the same unto them that Christ sends forth, where he is manifest. But ye men of Israel, and we may say ye men of all professions in Christendom without the possession of Christ, heare the words of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth, a man approved of God among you with great works and wonders, and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as you your selves also know, him I say ye have taken by the hands of the wicked, being delivered by the detereminat counsel and foreknowledg of God, and have crucified and slain, whom God hath raised up, and loosed the sorrowes of death, becaus it was impossible that he should be holden of it.</hi> And so <hi>Gods holy One did not see corruption, neither was his Soul left in the grave, whose heart did rejoyce and his tongue was glad, and his flesh did rest in hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And David knew that God had sworn with an oath unto him, that of the fruit of his loins, he would raise up Christ concerning the flesh, he knowing this before, speaking of the resurrection of Christ, saith that <hi>his Soul should not be left in the grave, neither his flesh should see corruption;</hi> this Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we are witnesses, and we the people of God, in scorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> are witnesses of this Jesus, and of his resurrection, to the men of Ifrael and all the men of the world, as <hi>Acts</hi> 7: 22, &amp;c. Which Jesus appeared three times to the Disciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was risen, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21: 14. Therefor let all the house of Israel know for a surety, that God hath made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus I say whom you crucified, he is risen and set down at the right hand of God.</p>
            <p>So we (the people of God called <hi>Quakers</hi>) do say let all the house of the professors of the Letter, without the possession, whether <hi>Iewes, Turks, Christians,</hi> or <hi>heathens</hi> know that there is no Salvation in any other Name under heaven, whereby they must be saved, but <hi>in the Name of Iesus Christ of Nazareth, which was crucified without the gates of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, whom God hath raised up from the dead,</hi> as in <hi>Acts</hi> 4: 10, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So the God of Abraham, Isaak and Jacob, and the God of our Fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom the Jewes betrayed and denyed in the presence of Pilat, when he had judged him to be delivered, before whom Jesus made a good confession, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6: 13. whom we are witnesses of,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44863:4"/>and are not ashamed to confess him before our persecutors. But the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Jewes denyed the holy One and the just, and desired a murderer to be given them, as many will do now, that crucify him to themselves afresh, as the Jewes that killed the Lord of life, whom God hath raised from the dead, whereof we are witnesses, I say we the people of God in scorn called Quakers, are witnesses, with the Apostles, of him against all such professors now, who desire a murderer rather then the Lord of life.</p>
            <p>But these things God shewed by the mouth of his Prophets, that Christ should suffer, and he hath thus fulfilled it: and so through him have we received remission of sinns, and refreshings from the presence of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And ye that do profess that Christ is come, as the Jewes professed he was to come, do not ye deny the holy One and the Just in your lives? who live unholy and unjust, and will not ye sooner receive a murderer, then the Saviour? and consent and persecut him where he is made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest now in his Saints? That which you doe unto them, ye doe unto him; but Christ is risen, whom the heavens must containe, untill the time that all things be restored, which God hath spoken by the mouths of all his holy Prophets, since the world began, <hi>Acts</hi> 3: 21. And Moses said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fathers, <hi>The Lord your God will raise up unto you a Prophet of your Brethren, like unto me, ye shall hear him in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you. For it shall be that every person that shall not hear that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</hi> Now this Prophet Christ Jesus we do hear, who doth fulfill the Prophets that prophesyed of him: and now do not you say there is no hearing of his voyce now adays, and is not the contrary to the Apostles, who said <hi>while it is called to day hear his voyce?</hi> And was not this after he was risen, <hi>and God hath spoken to us by his Son,</hi> as in Hebr. 1? And did he not speak to his Disciples, and to Paul and to Mary Magdalen after he was risen? And doth he not now speak from heaven? See that ye despise not him that speaks from heaven, for if they escaped not, that refused him that spake on earth, much less shall ye escape, if ye turn away from him that speaks from heaven, even JESUS who suffered without the gates of Jerusalem, and sanctifies his people with his blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12: 25. And therefor you that say there is no hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the prophet Christ's voyce now adays, do not you destroy your selves and people? And to Abraham God said, <hi>In thy seed sh ll all the kindreds of the earth be blessed,</hi> of whose seed Christ came, and so it was said unto the Jewes first, <hi>unto you hath God raised up his Son</hi> Jesus, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44863:5"/>him hath he sent to blesse you, in turning every one of you from your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity unto him. So [marke] you are blessed as you are turned every one from your iniquity, not in your iniquity, for he saith to the worker of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity <hi>depart from me, I know you not.</hi> For the true witnesses of Jesus Christ and of his refurrection, great grace was upon them all, and so it is now, as may be seen <hi>Acts</hi> 4: 33. where may be seen what work the Priests and the Elders the great Letter-professors made against them that were the true witnesses of Jesus, his birth, life, death and resurrection, as many of you, who have the form and not the power, have done against us, and therefore are we turned away from you. But we can say as the Apostle said to the Jewes, and to you that are in their Spirit, <hi>The God of our Fathers hath ruised up Iesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree,</hi> him hath God lifted up with his right hand, to be a <hi>Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sinns:</hi> and we are witnesses concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these things, which we say, yea and the holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him, testifies the same. But you that are disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, say, <hi>the holy Ghost is not to be looked for now adayes,</hi> and forbid us to speake in the powr of Jesus, though you'l use the name of Jesus, but in the forme, and deny the power and Spirit, persecut them that are in it, <hi>Acts</hi> 5: 30, 31, 32. But remember <hi>Gamaliel's</hi> counsel <hi>And Stephen being full of the holy Ghost looked stedfastly into heaven, and said, Behold the heavens open, and the Son of man</hi> [marke <hi>the Son of man</hi>] <hi>standing at the right hand of God;</hi> so with the holy Ghost he could see into heaven, and see Christ Jesus, and so do we, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: 3. where it is said, that <hi>no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Iesus accursed.</hi> Also no man can say <hi>that Iesus is Lord but by the holy Ghost,</hi> [marke] <hi>no man can say</hi> it, <hi>but by the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ye that say There is no holy Ghost to be looked for now adayes, as was amongst the Apostles, and teach so to the people, do not ye deny the promise of Christ, and the succession of the true ministers in the holy Ghost, which shall lead into all truth.</p>
            <p>And if no man can call Jesus the Lord, but by the holy Ghost, and ye deny having it your selves, and teaching it so to others, then ye can not be the faithfull witnesses of Jesus Christ the Lord, nor can ye truely call him Lord, neither are led into all truth by the holy Ghost, but by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ghost into errour, and so are no true Christians.</p>
            <p>For this Comforter or holy Ghost which Christ hath sent, he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44863:5"/>the world of their sin, and righteousness, and judgment and unbelief: so you are not reproved of your sin, of your righteousness, of your judgment and unbelief, if the <hi>Comforter</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> be not <hi>come</hi> to you, according to Christs promise, that he would send him after he was risen. And the Disciples of Christ then, and now, the Spirit of Truth, this Comforter doth lead them into all Truth, for <hi>he shall not speak of himself, but whatsoever he shall hear, he shall speak.</hi> So are not people to hear this Comforter, this holy Ghost, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son? Ioh.</hi> chapters 15 and 16. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 9, <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Who art thou Lord, and the Lord said, I am Ies us whom thou persecutest,</hi> and <hi>it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now you know that Jesus Christ was risen, but he was persecuting of him in his Saints: compared with <hi>Matth.</hi> 25 from ver. 40 to the end.</p>
            <p>So are not all they, that kick against that which pricks them, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters of the life of Jesus, where he is made manifest?</p>
            <p>And in <hi>Acts</hi> 10: 34, &amp;c. where <hi>Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</hi> and how God hath anoynted Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> with the holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with him; and we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the land of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whom they slew, and hanged on a tree, him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly, and we did eat and drink with him after he arose from the dead, and he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he, that is ordained of God, a Judg of quick and dead. And to this do we testify, which are the people of God, in scorn called <hi>Quakers. And to him</hi> (to wit, Christ) <hi>also gave all the Prophets witness, that through his Name, all that believe in him, shall receive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to believe in Christ, he teaches how to believe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. who saith, <hi>I am come a Light into the world, that whosoever believeth in me, shall not abide in darkness.</hi> And <hi>wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may become the children of the Light,</hi> ver. 36: 46. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7: 37, 38. <hi>Iesus stood up, and cryed, saying, if any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink:</hi> and <hi>he that believeth in me, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of water of life.</hi> And
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44863:6"/>
               <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:16. <hi>God so loved the world, that he sent his onely begoteen Son into the world, that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> And, <hi>as many as receive him, he gives them power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the sons of God, yea even to them that believe in his Name,</hi> Joh. 1:12. And <hi>he that believeth in him, shall not be condemned, but he that believeth not, is condemned already, because he believeth not in the Name of the onely begotten Son of God:</hi> to wit, in the Light, as Christ commands. And <hi>this is the condemnation, that Light is come into the world, but men love darkness rather then Light, because their works are evil, For every man that doth evil hates the-Light,</hi> he hates that Light which Christ commands to believe in, <hi>neither cometh to the Light, least his deeds should be reproved.</hi> So he is afraid of his evil deeds being reproved, and therefore can not believe in the Light, if he will not come to it: but he that doth Truth, cometh to the Light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God; and <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, is born of God,</hi> as John in his Epistle saith, <hi>and he that is born of God, overcometh the world. And he that believeth in the Son of God, hath the witness in himself.</hi> And this we witness, which are the true Believers in the Light: and <hi>he that hath the Son, hath life, and he that bath not the Son of God, hath not life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So all ye Letter-Professors of Christ, if ye have him not, you have no life, for Christ, whom God sent, speaks the word of God and he that believeth in his Son, hath eternal life in him, and he that believeth not in the Son of God, shall not see life, <hi>but the wrath of God abides upon him,</hi> Joh. 3:34, 35, 36. And the Son of God that spake the words of God, how people should believe, said, <hi>believe in the Light;</hi> for he was come a Light into the world, and in him was Life, and this life was the Light of men, and that was the true Light, <hi>which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> And <hi>he was in the world, and the world know him not.</hi> So the world knows him not now, though the world was made by him, and he is in the world by his Light, though they will not believe in it, but love the darkness rather then the Light, and will not come to it, least it should reprove them of their evil deeds, as the Apostle saith <hi>Whatsoever doth reprove and make manifest, is light.</hi> So they can not see Christ Jesus the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world, without the Light, which is called <hi>the life in him,</hi> and <hi>Light in men.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44863:6"/>
            <p>And so the unbelievers now, though they may profess Christ is come, like the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to come who persecuted Christ in the days of his flesh, but he is risen out of their reach. And now the same spirit persecuts his Believers and Disciples that believe in the Light, which is Life in him, and Light in them, as <hi>Iohn</hi> teaches. So now they are persecuting the Light and Life of Christ, where it is manifest in his members, for every one that doth evil, hates the Light, and so hates Christ, his Light, his Life. But we who are the people of God, and in scorn called <hi>Quakers</hi> by them, are the believers in the Light, and children of the Light, with which we see our life hid in Christ; and are witnesses of Christs birth, suffering, death, and resurrection, and of his flesh, and of his Divinity, and can say <hi>he that hath the bride, is the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi> Joh. 3:29. And <hi>Acts</hi> 13:23. &amp;c. <hi>Of the seed of David hath God according to his promise, raised up to Israel a Saviour: and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever feareth God, to you is the word of Salvation sent, for the inhabitants of Ierusalem and the Rulers, because they knew him not, nor the words of the Prophets, which were read every Sabbath day amongst them, they have fulfilled them in condemning him, though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilat to kill him: and when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and put him into a sepulchre, wherin no man was before laid, but God hath raised him from the dead, and he was seen many days of them, which came up with him from Galilee unto Ierusalem, and we can not but speak those things which we have seen and heard,</hi> Acts 4:20.</p>
            <p>And so now consider you Professors, was not this the highest place of worship at Jerusalem, where the Scripturs and Prophets were read every Sabbath day, and they knew not the voice of the Prophets, though they read their words, like the Professors now, and yet did not they crucify him (to wit, the Jewes) without the gates of Jerusalem? And the Priests and Rulers were against him, and knew him not in his birth, sufferings, death and resurrection.</p>
            <p>And now you that read the Scripturs with the same persecuting spirit, do not you crucify him afresh to your selves, and persecut him in his members, and put him to open shame, as it's said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6:6?</p>
            <p>And <hi>Acts</hi> 13:47. <hi>I have set thee a Light of the Gentiles, that thou mayst be my Salvation to the ends of the world.</hi> And so Christ who is the Light, is the Salvation to the ends of the world, and the Gentiles are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44863:7"/>glad of this, and glorify the Word of the Lord, which none can doe but in the Light, which is the Life in the Word. And we declare ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods promise made to the Fathers, which God hath fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us his children, in that he raised up Jesus, as it is written in the 2 Psalm, <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, no more to turn to the grave, wherefore he saith in another place <hi>Thou wilt not suffer thy holy One to see corruption;</hi> though David lay with his Fathers, and saw corruption, but he whom God raised up saw no corruption. <hi>Be it known unto you therefore men and brethren,</hi> saith the Apostle, and say the people of God in scorn called <hi>Quakers</hi> to all the sons of Adam, <hi>that through this man,</hi> to wit Christ Jesus, <hi>whom God hath raised up, is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins, and from all things from which you could not be justifyed by the Law of Moses.</hi> By him, to wit Christ, every one that believeth is justifyed. And what is it to believe? To believe in the Light, as Christ saith: if not, he is condemned, and then not justifyed, as you may see, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:12. and <hi>Act.</hi> 13:32, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now the time of ignorance, as the Apostle saith, (who preached Christs birth, death and resurrection) <hi>the times of ignorance God wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at,</hi> but now he admonishes all men every where to repent▪ So if God and Christ do admonish, he doth it by his power and Spirit, as <hi>Acts</hi> 17:30. <hi>Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judg the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath appoynted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath given an assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</hi> Therefore if he would have all men to repent, he would have all men to be saved, and their destruction is of themselves.</p>
            <p>And this we the people of God, in scorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do witness and have the assurance of. As the Apostle saith, <hi>But this I confess un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, that after that way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my Fathers, and believe all things, which are written in the Law and the Prophets, and have hope towards God that the resurrection of the dead which they themselvs look for also, shall be both of just and unjust; and herein I endeavour my self to exercise a good Conscience towards God and towards men,</hi> Acts 23:14 to 16.</p>
            <p>This confession the Apostle made before <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Ananias,</hi> the high priests and the elders; and this is, and hath been our confession amongst all your high Priests and elders, above 20 years ago, and unto this day.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:44863:7"/>
            <p>And the Apostle in his confession, <hi>Acts</hi> 26:18. saith, he was sent to <hi>turn the people from darkness to the Light, and from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan unto God, that they may receive the forgiveness of sins, and an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them that are sanctified, by faith in Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now have not many of you separated Professors and Priests, and others, scoffed at this Light, and called it <hi>an idol</hi> and <hi>darkness?</hi> But can any receive the remission and forgiveness of sins, and so have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among them that are sanctified, but who are turned from the darkness to the Light, and from the power of Satan unto God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true ministers doctrine, which we possess and are witness<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of, against them that turn them from this Light to darkness, and keep them in Satans power from Gods? And was not this doctrin a wonder amongst the professing Jewes, and before <hi>Agrippa</hi> (whose eyes were not open, like yours) of turning people from darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might receive remission of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified? [mark] are sanctified, that is already don, though the <hi>Apostle</hi> said, he had <hi>obtained help from God unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things then those which the Prophets and Moses did say should come; that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew Light unto the people and unto the Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And also was not this a strange doctrin think you then? and is it not so now which we do witness, by this Light which Christ hath shewed unto us, what <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets did say, that Christ should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and rise from the dead, and shew light to the Gentiles? This through the help of God are we daily witnesses of, to small and great who are dead with Christ, and are risen with Christ: <hi>for,</hi> as the Apostle saith, <hi>if ye be dead with Christ, and risen with Christ, seek those things which are above,</hi> Coloss. 3:1. and this we are in the practise of, and can not seek after your things which are below, though you rage against us, and persecut us with tongue and hand. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>God which had promised before by his Prophets, in the holy Scripturs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Son Iesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid according to the flesh,</hi> [mark] <hi>and declared to be the Son of God, touching the Spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection of the dead, by whom we have received Grace, through which we are witnesses, and are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44863:8"/>called and made to declare and confess to the Name of Iesus. For the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The just shall live by faith. For we are not ashamed of the Gospell of Christ, for it is the power of God unto Salvation to every one that believeth.</hi> And therefore we can not but warn all in the name of Jesus, knowing that <hi>God shall judg the secrets of all mens hearts, according to the Gospel,</hi> as the Apostle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2:16. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 3:24, 25. <hi>We are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied freely by his Grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Iesus, whom God hath set forth to be a reconciliation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness, by the forgiveness of sins, that are past through the patience of God.</hi> And this we witness, blessed be the Lord God, through Jesus Christ for ever.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Rom</hi> 4:25. Christ <hi>who was delivered to death for our sins, and is risen for our justification, then being justified by faith we have peace with God, through our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom also we have access through faith unto his Grace, wherein we stand,</hi> [mark] <hi>and rejoyce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hope of the glory of God, and this hope makes not ashamed, becaus the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us. For Christ when we were yet of no strength, at his time dyed for the ungodly, but seting out his love towards us, seing that while we were yet sinners Christ dyed for us, much more then being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemys we were reconciled to God, through the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life, and not onely so, but we also rejoyce in God through our Lord Iesus Christ, through whom we have now received attonement,</hi> Rom. 5:1, 2.</p>
            <p>And this we witness who are in scorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> but Christ did not dye for sinners, that they should live all their life time in sin, and dye in their sins; but that as sin had reigned unto death, so Grace might also reign through righteousness unto eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. <hi>For know you not that all we that have been baptized into Iesus Christ, have been baptized into his death. We are buried then with him by baptism into his death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, so we also walk in newness of life</hi> (mark you Professors, <hi>in newness of life</hi>) <hi>for if we be grafted with him into the similitud of his death, even so shall we be of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, knowing this that our old man is crucified with him</hi> (mark,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44863:8"/>
               <hi>is crucified,</hi> then it is done) <hi>that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin, for when ye were servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness:</hi> and as the Apostle saith, <hi>his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ye are whom ye do obey; wherefore if we be dead with Christ, we believe also we shall live with him, knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dyeth no more, death hath no more dominion over him, for in that he dyed, he dyed once to sin, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</hi> So (mark) people must dye with Christ; if they will live with Christ, whom death hath no more dominion over. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>reckon ye also that ye are dead to sin, but alive to God in Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> (mark, <hi>alive in Christ Iesus</hi>) so people must be alive in him, not in old Adam. <hi>And now being made free from sin, and made ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants unto God, ye have your fruits unto holiness, and your end ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life through Iesus Christ our Lord. For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</hi> So they that be free from righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and whose darkness can not comprehend the Light, and whose doctrin is, <hi>they can not be made free from sin</hi> while they be upon the earth, nor the old man, nor the body of sin: this is another doctrin then the Apostle preached, who said <hi>the old man is crucified:</hi> and this is to preach up the old mans life, and not the new man Christ Jesus, as you may see, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 and 7 chap. &amp;c. <hi>Now if we suffer with Christ, we shall also be glorified with him,</hi> Rom. 8:17. So people must dye with Christ, if they will live with Christ, and suffer with him, if they will be glorified with Christ. Now it is an easie matter to make an outward profession of Christs death, but it's another matter to come to dye with Christ and suffer with him; which they must do, if they will come to live, and be glorified with him. Again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7:9. <hi>I was once alive without the Law,</hi> (yet he had been a strict professor of the Law. So are not you strict professors alive without the Gospel?) <hi>but when the commandement came, sin revived and I dyed,</hi> saith the Apostle. Can ye professors say so, as many of us can, who were alive in a profession without the possession, where we see many of you yet remaining? <hi>And the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Iesus hath made me free from the Law of sin and death.</hi> Now ye Professors, ye are far off from being made free from the Law of sin and death, when you plead for it for terme of life, and are offended at us that plead for fredom by the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44863:9"/>Law of the Spirit of life, which is in Christ Jesus. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>God send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his onely Son in the likeness of sinfull flesh, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh,</hi> (so, can you witness the sending of the Son of God to condemn the sin in your flesh?) <hi>that the righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, which walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin. But the Spirit is Life for righteousness sake, but if Christ be not in you, your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is alive because of the sin;</hi> and so you may call him Lord, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess him without you, and say Ye have preached in his name, but such workers of iniquity he will bid depart, that live in sin, and plead for it to the grave. <hi>But if the Spirit of him, that raised Iesus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raises up Christ from the dead shall quicken your mortal bodys, because that his Spirit dwelleth in you.</hi> and this we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>And must not people be made like to the image of the Son of God, who is the first born among many brethren. <hi>For God who spared not his own Son, but gave him to death for us all, how shall he not with him give us all things? For Christ who is dead and risen again, who is at the right hand of God also making request for us,</hi> Rom. 8. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 9:33. as it is written, <hi>Behold I lay in Zion a ston of stumbling and a Rock of offence, and every one that believeth in him shall not be a shamed.</hi> And this is that Christ, that the wise master-builders did reject in their own wisdom (as you may read in the Evangelists) that pretended to build people up unto heaven, as many do now without the life and Spirit of the Apostles. <hi>But Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness sake, to every one that believes, but the righteousness which is of faith speaks on this wise, Say not in thine heart Who shall ascend into heaven, that is to bring Christ from above, or who shall descend into the deep to bring Christ again from the dead. But what saith it? The Word is near thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart. This is the Word of faith which we preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we are come to this righteousness of faiths speaking, and to this Word in our hearts which the Apostle preached, <hi>and can confess with our mouths the Lord Iesus, and believe in our hearts that GOD raised him from the dead, who is the Saviour. For with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confesseth unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So this belief is beyond a Pharisees belief, for <hi>he that believeth
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44863:9"/>is born of God,</hi> and he that believeth in the Light is born of the Light, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>And it may be said unto you Professors, as <hi>David</hi> said, and <hi>CHRIST</hi> and the <hi>Apostle</hi> to the professing Jewes, <hi>Let their table be made a snare, and a net and a stumbling block, even for a recompence unto them, let their backs be bowed down always,</hi> Rom. 11:9, 10.</p>
            <p>Now the Church in the primitive times, which the Apostle writs to, <hi>I beseech you brethren</hi> (saith he) <hi>by the mercys of God, that ye give up your bodys a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able service</hi> of him. Rom. 12:1. For as it is said, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6:20. <hi>Know ye not that your bodys are the temples of the Holy Ghost? For ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your bodys and in your spirits, for they are Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what price was this they were bought withall? Is not this the blood of Christ Jesus? So it is not a puft-up profession, nor serving God with your lips, but the offering up the body a living sacrifice, and a glorifying God with body, soul and spirit, which are his.</p>
            <p>For none of us is to live to himself, nor to dye to himself, saith the Apostle, <hi>For whether we live, we live unto the Lord, or whether we dye, we dye unto the Lord;</hi> or, whether we live or dye, we are the Lords: <hi>For Christ Iesus therefore dyed and rose again and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the quick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So no true Christians must live to themselvs, but to him that dyed for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14:7, 8, 9. &amp;c. And the Saints are to <hi>receive one another, as Christ also received us,</hi> saith the Apole, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15:6, 7, <hi>to the glory of God:</hi> and to be <hi>like-minded one to another according to Christ Iesus,</hi> and <hi>that with one mouth they may praise God, even the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> ver 5. And vers. 18. the Apostle saith, <hi>I dare not speak of any thing which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient in word and deed.</hi> Mark this, ye Professors, if ye durst speak no more but that Christ works by you or in you, ye would have little to say, and ye would not find fault with the people of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who speak as Christ hath wrought in them.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Rom.</hi> 16:25. <hi>To him now that is of power to establish you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Gospel and preaching of Iesus Christ, by the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began.</hi> Now ye Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors can not know this mystery, nor this secret, but by revelation, which ye deny.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:44863:10"/>
            <p>And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1:2. there ye may see how we are sanctified in Christ Jesus, <hi>that ye may be blameless in the day of our. Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> ver. 6, 8. <hi>and the testimony of Iesus Christ hath been confirmed in you:</hi> marke <hi>in you, for God is faithfull by whom ye are called, unto the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of his Son Iesus Christ our Lord. Now I beseech you brethren by the Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that ye all speak one thing.</hi> Then ye must come out of the many things, which make divisions. <hi>And the Iewes,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>require a signe, and the Grecians seek after wisdom.</hi> And are not you Professors of the same spirit, like the Jewes and Grecians? Do not you cry for signes and miracles, and seek after wisdom? <hi>But we preach Christ crucified, to the Iewes a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness,</hi> 1 Cor. 1:22. <hi>But ye are of him in Christ,</hi> saith the Apostle, ver. 30: <hi>who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and redemption,</hi> which we witness, Blessed be God for ever. <hi>But the natural man,</hi> saith he, 1 Cor. 2:14. <hi>perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi> And this we witness, which you Professors deny any one hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit as the Apostles had. So you are not like to know the things of God, but run into strife and contention about them, with your natural mens perceivings.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle saith, <hi>I esteem not to know any thing amongst you, save Iesus Christ and him crucified; for we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God hath determined before the world unto our glory, which none of the princes of the world hath known, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> 1 Cor. 2. And the Apostle saith, <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 4:16. &amp; 9:1. So we cannot follow you, but as ye follow Christ. <hi>For the kingdom of God</hi> (saith he) <hi>is not in words, but in power,</hi> 1 Cor. 4:20. <hi>And God hath raised up the Lord Iesus</hi> (saith he) <hi>and shall raise us up by his power, and we do know that our bodys are members of Christ, and he that is joyned to the Lord is one spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. And the Apostle saith, <hi>Neither theeves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, nor adulterers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you, but ye are wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of our Lord Iesus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 9, 10, 11. Marke, <hi>are washed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44863:10"/>are sanctified, are justified.</hi>So for covetous ones, adulterers, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, theeves and railers to make a profession of Christs death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, and live in their sins; this is to profess him with the lips, but deny him in their works, not being washed. For Christ comes to call sinners to repentance, and he dyed for their sin, not that they should live in it, and plead for it for terme of life.</p>
            <p>And 1 Cor. 7:23. it's said, <hi>Ye are bought with a price, so come to be the Lords free men:</hi> and as Christ saith, <hi>if the Truth hath made you free, ye are free indeed.</hi> For Truth makes free from the devil, who is out of Truth. And the Apostle saith 1 Cor. 8:6. <hi>To us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him.</hi> Marke, <hi>we in him, and one Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> This we witness. And the Apostle saith 1 Cor. <hi>Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted him, and were destroyed of the serpents.</hi> And therefore ye Professors take heed of tempting him in a profession with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out possession of him, least ye be found mockers of him.</p>
            <p>Likewise the Apostle saith, what he <hi>received from the Lord, that</hi> he <hi>delivered</hi> unto them, 1 Cor. 11:23. Now do not you deliver any thing to the people, but what you receive from the Lord? Then ye must deny your own principle, who say, There is no hearing the voice of God now adays. And doth not the Apostle tell you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. that you have nothing if ye have not love; if ye have faith and gifts, and prophecys and tongues, and give your bodys to be burned, and your goods to the poor, if ye have not love, ye are but like tinckling cymbals and sounding brass. Where is all your profession then of God and Christ, and what good doth it you, who make but a tinckl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your cymbals, and sounding with your brass, whilst you are out of love, and in a persecuting spirit?</p>
            <p>And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the Apostle saith, <hi>First of all I delivered unto you that which I received,</hi> marke, <hi>how that Christ dyed for our sins, according to the Scripturs, and that he was seen of Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

But now is Christ risen from the dead, and is made the first fruits of them that slept. For as in Adam all dyed, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. The first man is of the earth earthly, the second man</hi> (marke, <hi>man</hi>) <hi>is the Lord from heaven:</hi> as it's also
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44863:11"/>written, <hi>The first Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So here is the Heavenly man, here is the Earthly man, here is the Spiritual body, here is the Natural body, and <hi>as we have born the image of the Earthly, so shall we bear the image of the Heavenly.</hi> So it is the Second man the Lord from heaven that redeems the Earthly man, and the Just that suffered for the unjust. <hi>And thanks be unto God,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>which giveth us victory through Iesus Christ our Lord:</hi> and thus we declare and witness that which the Scripture doth declare, and can say, <hi>The Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ be with all that love him.</hi> And 2 Cor. 1:5. where the Apostle saith, <hi>The suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ abound in us.</hi> Have ye known this, ye Professors? <hi>And ye are our Epistles written in our hearts,</hi> 1 Cor. 3:3. <hi>written not with pen and ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God, in the fleshly tables of the heart, in that ye are manifest to be the Epistles of Christ.</hi> Marke, this Epistle was written with the Spirit of God in the table of the heart, these are manifest to be the the Epistles of Christ, which ye can not read without the Spirit of God, which ye have often denyed to have as the Apostles had. And the Apostle saith, <hi>Who hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter</hi> (marke) <hi>but of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.</hi> For it's said, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses put a vail over his face,</hi> that the children of Israel should not look unto the end of that, which was to be abolished, which vail in Christ is put away. But a worse vail you have put over your faces, that make a great bustle about the Scripturs, and are not in the Spirit that gave them forth.</p>
            <p>Now the Lord is this Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, and where it is not, there is imprisonment, persecution and bondage. <hi>But we all behold as in a mirrour the glory of God, with open face, and are changed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> and this we possess and witness, <hi>who preach not our selves, but the Lord Iesus Christ, and our selves your servants for Christs sake. For God that commanded Light to shine out of darkness,</hi> is he which hath <hi>shined in our hearts, to give the Light of the knowledg of the glory of God in the face of Iesus Christ. But we have this treasur in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en vessels, that the excellency of the power might be of God, and not of us,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:44863:11"/>
            <p>
               <hi>And we are afflicted on every side</hi> that witness this, <hi>and persecuted, but not forsaken, Every where we bear about in our bodys</hi> (marke, <hi>in our bodys) the dying of our Lord Iesus, that the life of Iesus might also be made manifest in our bodys.</hi> (marke <hi>in our bodys.) For we which live are always delivered unto death, for Iesus sake, that the Life of Iesus might be manifest in our mortal flesh, because we have the same Spirit of faith,</hi> as it is written <hi>I believe and therefore have I spoken, we also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and therefore speak, knowing that he who hath raised up the Lord Iesus, shall also raise us up by Iesus Christ,</hi> and with our hearts we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, and with our mouths make confession unto Salvation.</p>
            <p>And 2 Cor. 5. <hi>We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ, that every man may receive the things which he hath done in his body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath done, whether they be good or evil. Knowing therefore the terrours of the Lord we do perswad men</hi> to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and to turn from sin and evil, and obey him; <hi>For the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judg, that if Christ dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all, that they which live should not henceforth live to themselves, but unto him which dyed for them and rose again.</hi> So here is a living to Christ, it is not onely a mouth profession, and an outward belief; <hi>For the devils believe and tremble,</hi> for he that believes in the Light becomes a child of the Light. And the Apostle saith, <hi>Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh, yea though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him</hi> [so] <hi>no more. Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creatur; old things are past away, behold all things are become new.</hi> And 2 Cor. 5. <hi>All things are of God which hath reconciled us to God by Iesus Christ: For God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their sins unto them, for he hath made Christ sin for us, which knew no sin, that we should be made the righteousness of God in him</hi> (marke <hi>in him</hi>) and who are in Christ are new creaturs. Now the old creaturs and such as are out of Christ, do make a profession without the possession, that's but like the Pharisees profession, 2 Cor. 7.</p>
            <p>So consider all ye Professors, are ye new creatures? Are ye made the righteousness of God in Christ? Do you begin to cleanse your selves from the filthiness of your flesh and spirit, and grow up unto full holiness in the fear of the Lord? Is your warfar spiritual, and not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, casting down the imaginations, and every high thing that is exait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44863:12"/>against the knowledg of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ, 2 <hi>cor.</hi> 10:4, 5. And Paul speaks of the Truth of Christ <hi>in</hi> him, and that he had espoused them to one husband, that he might present the Saints as a pure virgin to Christ. Then they must be free from sin, and must not plead for sin forterme of life, as you professors do, for there is <hi>no fellowship betwixt Light and darkness,</hi> as 2 Cor. 6:14.</p>
            <p>And 2 <hi>cor.</hi> 13:3. &amp;c. <hi>Ye seek a proof of Christ that speaks in me,</hi> (marke, <hi>a proof</hi> of Christs speaking in the Apostle) <hi>which towards you</hi> (saith he) <hi>is not weak, but is mighty in you</hi> (marke, <hi>in you</hi>) And further he saith, though <hi>he was crucified concerning his infirmitys, yet</hi> he <hi>lived</hi> (to wit, Christ) through the <hi>power of God</hi> (marke, he that was crucified) <hi>and we no doubt are weak in him, but we</hi> shall <hi>live</hi> with him, through the <hi>power of God,</hi> &amp;c. which we witness. Wherefore <hi>prove your selves</hi> whether <hi>you be in</hi> the faith, <hi>examin your selves, know ye not your own selves,</hi> how that <hi>Iesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobats?</hi> Marke, we have proved our selves, and examined our selves; and know Christ Jesus is in us. <hi>And if</hi> Christ <hi>be in you,</hi> as was said before, <hi>your body is dead because of sin, and you are alive to God,</hi> &amp;c and not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats.</p>
            <p>And so it's the duty of all Christians to prove and examin themselves, whether they be in that faith that workes by love, that Christ is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of; whether Christ be in them yea or nay, that they be not found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probats, for reprobats may make a profession of Christ, in that birth that will persecut them that are born of the Spirit, as we have seen a a great deal of, among you Professors these 20 years. But the Apostle saith 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. The <hi>Grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost be</hi> with <hi>you all, Amen.</hi> This we witness.</p>
            <p>And now ye that deny that there is any immediate inspiration of the Holy Ghost to be looked for now adays, ye are out of the communion of the holy Ghost, and out of the praying in the holy Ghost, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, which was and is the true Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and fellowship, that Christ is the Spiritual Head of. And Gal. 1:4. Christ that <hi>gave himself for our sins,</hi> that he might <hi>deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God,</hi> &amp;c. Now marke, and see whether you are delivered from this present evil world,

And Paul was an Apostle <hi>not of man, nor by man,</hi> but <hi>by</hi> the <hi>revelation</hi> of Jesus Christ, and God the Father which hath raised him from the dead. And the Gospel which he preached, was <hi>not after man;</hi> no more is it now, but <hi>by</hi> the <hi>revelation</hi> of Jesus Christ. And when the Son of God was <hi>revealed in</hi> the Apostle, he preached him: but do not many of you Professors and others preach the Son of God, before he be revealed in you? <hi>I live,</hi> saith he, Gal. 2:20. <hi>yet not I,</hi> now, <hi>but</hi> Christ liveth <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Now this we testify should be every true Christians life. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3:13. &amp;c. <hi>Christ</hi> hath <hi>redeemed us from</hi> the <hi>curse of</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> when he was made a curse for us, that the <hi>blessing of</hi> Abraham might <hi>come upon</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> through <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that <hi>we</hi> might <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> through faith. So then they, that be of faith, are blessed with faithfull Abraham; which we witness, Blessed be the Lord for ever.</p>
            <p>But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by the faith of Jesus Christ should be given to them that believe. The <hi>Law was</hi> the <hi>School-master to bring us to Christ, that we might be made right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous by faith</hi> (marke, <hi>made righteous by faith) for after that faith is come, we are no longer under a Schoolmaster. For ye are all the Sons of God by faith in Christ Iesus. For all ye that are baptized into Christ, have put on Christ</hi> (marke, <hi>put</hi> him <hi>on</hi>) and baptized into Christ: this is his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism with fire and the holy Ghost, who throughly purgeth the floor, and gathereth the wheat into his garner. <hi>But when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman, and made under the Law, that he might redeem them which were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of his sons. And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, which cryeth Abba Father, Gal.</hi> 4:4.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle tells the Galatians, he <hi>travelled in</hi> birth <hi>again, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Christ be formed in them.</hi> And in Christ neither <hi>circumeision nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision availeth any thing, but faith that works by love,</hi> as Gal. 4.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44863:13"/>
            <p>And Gal. 6. <hi>In Christ neither circumcision nor uncircumcision availeth any thing but a new creatur.</hi> And cap. 5. <hi>If ye are led by the Spirit ye are not under the Law. And they that are Christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts:</hi> and this we do believe and witness.</p>
            <p>But see you Professors by what spirit you are led, you that talk so much of Christ, and see that your affections and lusts are crucisied. But is it not your principle that they shall not be crucified on this side the grave, who plead for sin and imperfection to the grave? And Eph. 1:4. and so on: <q rend="margQuotes">God hath chosen us in him (to wit, Christ) before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy without blame before him in love, (marke, here is a new life, more then a bare profession) by whom we have redemption in his blood, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of sins, according to his mercys, that in the dispensation of the fulness of time he might gather together in one, all things both which are in heaven and which are in earth, even in Christ.

And grieve not the holy Spirit of God by whom ye are sealed</hi> (said the Apostle) <hi>unto the day of redemption.</hi> And now ye Professors and others may say how can we grieve it, when we do not look for such a spirit, as the Apostles had? <hi>But let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you with vain words, for the wrath of God cometh upon the children of disobedience.</hi> And <hi>no unclean person hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</hi> And the Apostle saith, <hi>Be ye followers of God as dear children, and walk in love as Christ hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savour unto God. But fornication, uncleanness and covetousness, let it not be once named among you as becometh saints: neither filthyness nor foolish talking nor jesting, which are things not comely, but rather giving of thanks.</hi> Here ye see what a Christians life must be, it is not an outward talk, as ye may see, Eph. 5.</p>
            <p>And Eph. 4:32. <hi>Be ye courteous and tender-hearted one unto another, forgiving one another.</hi> But this hath been wanting amongst you, that have professed your selves Christians, and made a great boast and talk of Christ, but have persecuted the appearance and life of Christ in his people, for the fruits of the Spirit are in all goodness, righteousness and truth and love, &amp;c. and these fruits are wanting amongst you Professors, and others called Christians.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle speaks of the great secret and mystery concerning Christ and the Church, comparing them to <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife;</hi> how he sanctifieth and cleanseth it by the washing of water through the word, that he might make it unto himself a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blame. Marke, all ye that call your selves gathered churches, see who is the Head of them, and what spots and wrinkles are in them. But we can not but give thanks for all things to God, even the Father, in the Name of Jesus Christ the holy Head, who makes his church holy.</p>

            <p>And Eph. 6. <hi>For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalitys and powers, and against the Rulers of darkness, the prince of the darkness of this world, and against spirituall wickednesses</hi> which are <hi>in high places.</hi> And therefore all true Christians are to put on the armour of God and the spiritual weapons, that they may stand against the assaults of the devil, to wit, the shield of faith, the helmet of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these weapons we owne: and may not all people see that those weapons have been wanting amongst you that profess your selves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and not in the possession of the true Christians life? For had ye been in it, ye would have stood as the Apostles and the rest of the saints and true Christians did: to make a profession of Christ when the sun shines, and when the storme comes, then to shut up your doores. So how often have you taken leave of your God and Christ? and he hath had no witness born by you, our desire is you may come to see your selves, and your fallen state. And he that hath begun the good work in his Saints, will perform it unto the day of Christ: this we know, and the fellowship is in the Gospel, that is in the power of God, not in the form without the power.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle saith, <hi>God is my record how I long after you all</hi> from my very heart root <hi>in Iesus Christ</hi> (marke, <hi>in Christ Iesus</hi>) that Christ may be magnified in my body, whether by life or death. Here was a stedfast minister. <q rend="margQuotes">For, Phil. 1. Christ is to me both in life and death advantage. Let your conversation therefore be as becomes the Gospel of Christ, for unto you it is given not onely to believe in Christ, but to suffer for his sake.</q> This we do witness, and it is sulfilled amongst us: but ye Professors see how your conversation is as becomes the Gospel of Christ, ye that profess so much of it. Also <hi>Let the same mind be in you</hi> (saith the Apostle, Phil. 1.) <hi>that was even in Christ Iesus.</hi> And 1 Cor. 2:16. <hi>But we have the mind of Christ,</hi> which every true Christian should witness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now Christ who being in the form of God thought it no robbery to be equal with God, but he made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made like unto men, and was found in the shape as a man,</hi> [marke] <hi>he humbled himself and became obedient to the death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every name, that at the Name of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44863:15"/>Iesus every knee should bow, both of things in Heaven and things in Earth and under the Earth, and</hi> that <hi>every tongue</hi> should <hi>confess.</hi> And this we the people of God, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do confess, that Jesus Christ is the Lord to the glory of God the Father. For it is God that worketh <hi>in you</hi> and <hi>in us,</hi> both the will and the deed of his good pleasur, that ye may be blameless and pure, and sons of God, without rebuke in the midst of a naughty and crooked generation; amongst whom to shine as Lights, holding fast the Word of Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this should be every true Christians duty and practice.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle saith, <hi>For all seek their own things, and not the things of Christ Iesus.</hi> And are there not too many such in our age, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess him; as was in the Apostl's day, seeking their own things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. and not the things of Christ Jesus.

Yea doubtless I think all things but loss, for the excellent knowledg, sake of Iesus Christ my Lord, for whom I have accounted all things loss,</hi> [marke] <hi>have counted, and do judg them to be dung, that I may winn Christ.</hi> And this we witness, which should be every true Christians mind and duty. <hi>That I may know Christ and the vertue of his resurrection, and the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of his sufferings, and be made conformable to his death, that by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.</hi> Now this should be every true Christians mind, but here is a fellowship in the sufferings or afflictions, and to be made conformable to his death. Who will come into this fellowship, think ye now, of the Letter-Professors, that put confidence in their flesh, and plead for the old man and the body of death and sin, as long as they live? Such will not follow hard towards the marke of the price of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, but raile at us and persecut us that do. But many walk in their evil wayes, that are <hi>enemys to the cross of Christ, whose end is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whose god is their belly, whose glory is their shame, who mind earthly things.</hi> Such then might make a great profession of Christ, as such now do. <hi>But our conversation is in Heaven,</hi> saith the Apostle, (marke, <hi>is in heaven) from whence also we look for the Saviour the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And this we witness, where every true Christians conversation should be.</p>

But Christ had <hi>blotted out the handwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ordinances, and took them out of the way,</hi> and so <hi>fastened them to the cross, and hath spoiled principalitys and powers, and triumphed over them in the same cross.</hi> This is Christ whom we do believe in and witness.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle saith, <hi>Let no man condemn you in meats nor drinks, nor holy days, nor Sabbath-days, nor new moons,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which are but shaddows of things to come, but the body is of Christ.</hi> And we are to hold the <hi>Head Christ, whereof the body is furnished and knit together by joints and bands, and encreased with the encrease of God.</hi> And <hi>if ye be dead with Christ from the ordinances of the world, Touch not, tast not, handle not, which all perish with the using, after the commandments and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins of men.</hi> So they that are dead with Christ can not touch, but they that are not dead with Christ, touch perishing things, as ye may read, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.

            <p>And the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1:12. — <hi>the Gospel by the holy Ghost sent down from heaven.</hi> So this is according to the Apostle, and the Gospel is the power of God, which they had not received of man, nor by man, but of Jesus Christ, <hi>Gal</hi> 1:11. <hi>Wherefore gird up the loins of your minds, and be sober:</hi> and trust perfectly on the Grace that is brought unto you by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Now ye Professors that deny <hi>Revelation,</hi> ye deny that which brings the Grace and the Gospel from heaven. <hi>For we are not redeemed</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from our vain conversation, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed or without spot, which was ordained before the foundation of the world</hi> (marke) <hi>but was declared in the last times for your saks.</hi> And now ye Professors that talke so much of redemption by the blood of Christ, are not ye in your vain conversation, and unredeemed? By the which means, to wit, Christ, we do believe in God that raised Christ from the dead and gave him glory, that our faith and hope might stand in God. And the Apostle saith, <hi>seing your Souls are purified in obeying the Truth, through the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>being born again anew not of a mortal Seed, but immortal, by the Word of God which liveth and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for ever.</hi> And this we witness, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1, &amp;c.

            <p>And ye Professors, who have given new names to the Father, the Word and holy Ghost, as [<hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>three distinct Persons</hi>] and say the Scripture is your Rule for your doctrine, but there is no such rule in the Scripture, to call them by these new names, which the Apostle that gave forth the Scripture, doth not give them: and because we do not call the Father and the Word and Holy Ghost by your new names, therefore do ye falsly say that the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny the Father, Son and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Ghost, which we owne in those names and sound words, in which the holy men of God spake them forth by the holy Ghost, which ye give other new names to, and yet say, ye have not the same spirit, which they had that gave forth the Scriptures.

            <p>But we do witness this Spirits teaching, and do hear him; blessed be the Lord for ever. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. <q rend="margQuotes">These things write unto the Church, which is at Sardis, saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God (to wit, Christ) and the seven stars, I know thy works, for thou hast a name that thou livest, but thou art dead. </q> Marke, is not this the condition of many of the Professors in Christendom, that have the name <hi>Christian,</hi> but are dead from the Life, and Power and Spirit, that was in the Apostles? And upon such Christ will come as a thief. <hi>And thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee,</hi> saith Christ.

            <p>And again he saith, <hi>Write unto the Angel of the Church of Philadelphia, these things saith he that is holy and true,</hi> (to wit, Christ) <hi>which hath the key of David, which openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth, I have set before thee an open door, that no man can shut.</hi> And this we witness who have kept the Word, and have not denyed his Name.

            <p>And again: <q rend="margQuotes">Write these things, saith the Amen, the faithfull and true witness, the beginning of the creaturs of God.</q> And this was to the Angel of the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> who were neither hot nor cold. Look, ye Letter-Professors, to this, that say, ye are rich and have need of nothing; see if ye be not poor, blind, miserable, wretched and naked, &amp;c.

            <p>
               <hi>Behold,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>I stand at the door and knock:</hi> (what door is this, think ye?

            <p>And John (<hi>Rev.</hi> 5.) saw that no man in Heaven, nor in Earth, nor under the Earth was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. Therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> wept, because he saw no man was found worthy to open and read the book, nor to look thereon. But one said unto him, <q rend="margQuotes">Behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.</q> For it is he that opens, and he that shuts: and if he open, no man can shut,

               <hi>And all creaturs which are in Heaven and on the Earth, and under the Earth and in the Sea, and all that are in them heard I, saying, Praise and honour, glory and power be given to him that siteth upon the throne and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lamb for evermore</hi> And so he is to be worshipped that liveth for evermore, Rev. 5.

            <p>And there were then great voyces in heaven at the seventh Angels sounding, saying, <hi>The Kingdoms of this world are our Lords and his Christs, and he shall reign for evermore.</hi> And the 24 <hi>Elders</hi> which sat before God on their seats, <hi>fell down on their faces and worshipped God,</hi> (not the beast) <hi>saying, We give thee thanks, Lord God Almighty, which art,</hi> (that is, present) <hi>and which was, and which art to come; for

               <q rend="margQuotes">For the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them before our God day and night, but they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony: and they loved not their lives unto the death.

               <q rend="margQuotes">And then after the woman was gone into the wilderness, the beast rose out of the Sea, and the Dragon gave his power to him, and they worshipped the Dragon: and then the cry was, Who is able to make warr with the beast?

            <p>And <hi>Iohn</hi> said, <q rend="margQuotes">I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on mount Zion, and with him a hundred fourty four thousand, having his Fathers Name vvritten in their foreheads, and they sung a nevv song before the Throne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and no man could learn that song but the 144000 which were redeemed from the Earth, and in their mouths was found no guile, for they were without spot before the Throne of God.

And none know this new song, but they that are without spot and guile, and by the Spirit of God have their Fathers Name written in their foreheads.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">And I saw another Angel sleing through the midst of heaven, having the Everlasting Gospel to preach to them that dwelt upon the Earth, and to every kindred, tongue and nation, saying with a

            <p>Now what will ye Letter-Professors say to <hi>Iohn?</hi> Have not your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, kindreds and tongues had the Gospel?

            <p>And the third Angel followed them, saying with a loud voyce, <hi>If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, yea of the pure wine, which is poured into the cup of his wrath, and he shall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in fire and brimston before the holy Angels and before the Lamb.</hi> And this all must know who worship not God in Spirit and Truth; and they that do worship God, must come to Truth and the Spirit of God <hi>in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> And here is the patience of the Saints, here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. <hi>And I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, right blessed are the dead which</hi> hereafter <hi>dye in the Lord, even so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labours, and their works follow them.

            <p>And <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. <hi>I saw as if it were a sea of glass mingled with fire, and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and his image and his marke, and the number of his name standing at the Sea of Glass, having the harps of God,</hi> not the harps of men: <hi>and they sung the song of Moses the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, and the song of the Lamb,</hi> (marke, the Lamb Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus)

            <p>And when the seven Angels poured out the seven vials of the wrath of the Lord God Almighty upon the Earth, what sores fell upon them that had the mark of the Beast and worshipped his image?

            <p>But he saith, that ten kings shall hate the whoor, and shall make her desolat and naked, and eat her flesh and burn her with fire, which hath reigned over the kings of the Earth, for God hath put it in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to doe with one consent, for to give their kingdom unto the beast, untill the words of God be fulfilled, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>And I saw an Angel come down from heaven, with great power, so that the earth was lightened with his glory.</hi> (saith John) So as the Earth is lightened, Babylon falls, and at her fall what a cry is there among the merchants?

               <hi>For the Testimony of Iesus is the Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> &amp; this we bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to. And all ye Letter-Professors that deny Prophecy, and say it is ceased, Ye have not the Testimony of Jesus, for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy. And John saw the Heaven opened, and beheld a white horse, and he that sat on him was called <hi>Faithfull and True,</hi> and he judgeth and maketh warr in righteousness, and his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44863:35"/>eyes are as a flamme of fire, and on his Head many Crowns, and a Name written, that no man knew but himself, he was cloathed in a garment dipt in blood, whose Name is called <hi>The Word of GOD.</hi> This is Christ who is seen in heaven on the white horse, and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours which were in heaven follovved him upon vvhite horses, cloathed in <hi>white linnen, white and pure.</hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes">And out of his mouth vvent a sharp tvvo-edged svvord, that vvith it he should smite the Heathen, for he shall rule them vvith a rod of iron: and he it is that treadeth the wine-press of the fierceness of the wrath of Almighty God, and he hath upon his garment and upon his thigh a Name written, The <hi>King of Kings</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> and this is Christ, blessed be the Lord for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">And the beast and the mighty men of the Earth made warr with him and his followers, but the beast was taken, and the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that wrought miracles, whereby he deceived them rhat receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beasts marke, and them that worshipped his image: and these both were cast alive into the lake of fire that burneth with brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</q> And there is the end of the Beast and false prophet, that has been worshipped, and has deceived the world, that hath made warr against Christ that is on the white horse and his followers, who hath the victory. <q rend="margQuotes">And the remnant of them that worshipped the Beast, were slain with the Word that went out of his mouth,</q> as may be seen <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.

            <p>And so after the beast is in the lake of fire, and the false Prophet, <q rend="margQuotes">I saw Satan bound, and cast into the bottomless pit, and shut up and bound for a 1000 years: and I saw seats and they that sat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and judgment was given unto them. And I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus the Word of God, which did not worship the beast nor his image, neither had taken his marke upon their forehead, nor in their hands, and they shall reign with Christ a 1000 years: and blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection, for on such the second death shall have no power, and they shall reign with Christ a 1000 years. </q> He doth not say, Christ shall come and reign with them, but they shall reign with Christ a 1000 years, <q rend="margQuotes">and when the 1000 years are finished,

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44863:36"/> Satan shall be loosed out of prison for a little season, and he shall go &amp; deceive the people which are in the four quarters of the Earth, even <hi>God and Magog,</hi> to gather them to battel: and they went up into the plain of the Earth, which compassed the Saints about and the beloved city, but fire came down from God out of heaven &amp; devoured them; so there is an end of them also: and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of sire and brimstone, where the beast and false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were cast before, and shall be tormented even day and night for evermore.</q> And so here is the end of the devil also.</p>
            <p>And then John <q rend="margQuotes">saw also the dead both small and great stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and the books were opened, and another book which is the book of Life, and the dead were judged of those things which were written in the books (marke, in those books, where all mens words and actions are written in, according to their works) and all gave up their dead, and every man was judged according to his works, and death and hell delivered up there dead, and death &amp; hell was cast into the lake of fire: and this is the second death.</q> And whosoëver was not found written in the book of Life, was cast into the lake of fire. And this we know to be true, &amp; are witnesses of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. that God will fulfill &amp; perform in Christ Jesus. And then John <q rend="margQuotes">saw a new Heaven and a new Earth, when the Dragon, beast, whoor and false Prophets and devil were cast into the lake of fire: and Babylon was fallen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the first Earth passed away, and was no more seen. And he saw the holy City the new Jerusalem come down from God out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, prepared as a bride trimmed for her husband, and I heard a great voyce out of heaven saying, <hi>Behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be their God with them.</hi>
               </q> And this we witness, blessed be the Lord God for ever, who dwelleth with his people.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">And he that sat up on the throne said, Behold I make all things new, and he said unto me, Write, for these words are faithfull and true, and he said unto me, It is done, I am Alpha and Omega, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and end, to wit, Christ.

            </p>
            <p>But will not the sorcerers, whoormongers, idolaters, lyars and murderers say, that they are all believers in Christ? <hi>The devils believe, and tremble.</hi> But ye do not believe in the LIGHT, as Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which should lead you from the second death, but ye hate the Light, because your deeds are evil; and will not come to it, because it will reprove you. And so this is the condemnation that Light is come into the world, but men love darknses rather then Light: which Light ye should believe in, and so become children of the Light, as Christ has commanded. So every true believer believeth as Christ hath commanded, and in so doing they obey his command.</p>
            <p>And John said, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21. one of the seven Angels talked with him, saying, <hi>come, I will shew thee the bride the Lambs wife, and he shewed me the great City holy Ierusalem descending out of heaven from God.</hi> And he that shewed it John, carryed him away in the the spirit to a great high Mountain, &amp;c. And so ye can not see this holy City, new Jerusalem descending out of heaven from God, except ye be in the Spirit that John was in, but this Spirit ye deny. And so as the false city Babylon was thrown down, seen by John then, and seen by the same Spirit now, the great City holy Jerusalem, that descends out from God, is set up, having the glory of God, and her shining was like unto a stone most precious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the wall of the City had</hi> 12 <hi>foundations, and in them the Names of the Lamb &amp; of the</hi> 12 <hi>Apostles, and it had</hi> 12 <hi>gates, and the gates</hi> 12 <hi>Angels, and the names written of the</hi> 12 <hi>tribes of the children of Israel, and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measur the wall and the gates of the city: and the city lay four-square, and the length is as large as the bredth of it: and he measured the city with the reed</hi> 12000 <hi>furlongs.</hi>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44863:37"/>the height, length and bredth being at 12, is the compleatness, and the wall 12 times 12, the compleatness of a wall in cubits that is 144 cubits, the wall bearing proportion to the city, as cubits to furlongs, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing to the inclosed. The length and the bredth and the height were equal, and he measured the wall thereof 144 cubits, by the measure of a man, that is of the Angel: and the 12 gates were 12 Pearles, and every gate is of one pearle, and the streets of the city are of pure gold, as shining glass. And I saw no Temple therein, for the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and the Lamb are the Temple of it, and the city had no need of the Sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light of it, and the people that are saved shall walk in the Light of it (marke, <hi>walk,</hi> not onely <hi>talk</hi>) and the Kings of the Earth shall bring their glory and honour unto it, and the gates of it shall not be shut by day, for there shall be no night there: and the glory and honour of the Gentiles shall be brought unto it, and there shall enter into it <hi>no unclean thing,</hi> neither whosoever worketh abomination or lyes. But they which are written in the Lambs book of Life. (marke, in the Lambs book of Life) Though the gates stand open, and are not shut, none can enter in, no unclean one, nor any lyar. The Angels that stand at the gates, &amp; which are ministring Spirits in flammes of fire, will keep such out; <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p>And all ye Letter-Professors that plead for <hi>imperfection,</hi> and <hi>your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of sin and death to the grave,</hi> which are the Devils drudges, these gates are too strait and too narrow for you with that great luggage on your backs to enter.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Rev</hi> 22. John saw a <hi>pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystall, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</hi> Happy are they, that drink of this River. <hi>And in the midst of the street of it, and on each side the river was the Tree of Life, which bears twelve manner of fruits, and giveth fruits every moneth.</hi> This is a fruitfull tree that beareth every moneth, and is not this Christ? This is beyond all the trees in the Earth. And the <hi>leaves</hi> of this tree served to <hi>heal the Nations</hi> with, and there shall be no more curse but the Throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his Servants shall serve him; and they shall see his face, (to wit, the Lambs) and his <hi>Name</hi> shall be <hi>in their foreheads,</hi> and there shall be no night there, and they need no candle, nor light of the Sun, for the <hi>Lord God giveth them Light, and they shall reign
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44863:38"/>for evermore.</hi> These words are faithfull and true: and the Lord God of the holy Prophets sent his Angel to shew unto his Servants, the things which must shortly be fulfilled. <hi>Seal not up the words of this book, for the time is at hand. He that is unjust and filthy, let him be unjust and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy still.</hi> So he will plead for his filthiness as long as he liveth. <hi>He that is just and righteous, let him be just and righteous still.</hi> And he will plead for his righteousness, which he hath from Christ, as long as he liveth.</p>

               <hi>And I Iesus have sent my Angels to testify these things in the Churches.</hi> And the true Churches are to give regard and belief unto his words, though the false Churches do not. And this Iesus sent from heaven af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was risen: and this I tell you Professors that say there was no hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his voyce from heaven after he was risen. <hi>I am the Root,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>and of the generation of David, the bright and morning-Star, and the Spirit and bride saith, Come, and let him that heareth, say, come, and let him that thirsteth come, and let whosoever will, take of the water of life freely.</hi> And what could Christ say more? Here all are invited to this water of life freely, but people had rather spend their money for that which is not bread.</p>
            <p>The Bride, that is married to Christ, bids others come to the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Lamb, and the Spirit bids them come to Christ: but if they will neither hear the Spirit nor the bride, they are left without excuse, and he that heareth Christ is commanded to bid others come, and take of the water of Life freely, and to come to Christ, and to hear him, as God saith, <hi>this is my beloved Son, hear ye him,</hi> in whom he is wel pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not to hear them, that do displease him, but <hi>learn of me,</hi> saith Christ <hi>for I am the Way, the Truth and the Life: and no man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi> And this we witness, (blessed be the Lord for ever) in the same Spirit that gave forth the Scripturs, therefore as John
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44863:38"/>saith, <hi>He that hath an ear to hear let him hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we know as Peter saith, that <hi>no prophecy</hi> in the Scripture is of <hi>any privat interpretation,</hi> 2 Pet 1:21. And now are not all ye Professors of the Letter, that say ye have not the same Spirit that gave forth the Scripturs, private interpreters of them? And yet follow your own spirit, as the Prophet saith, and see nothing: for the prophecy came not in the old time by the will of man, but <hi>holy men of God spak as they were moved by the holy Ghost,</hi> and ye deny the having of this holy Ghost now adays, and call it an extraordinary Spirit. Ye deny that which Christ sends to lead his Church, into all Truth by: and make a mock at the movings of it, and a scoff, as too often we have heard. <hi>And none can call Iesus Lord but by the holy Ghost:</hi> and the true Church fellowship is in the holy Ghost. So it is an extraordinary Spirit that people must pray and have fellowship in, and call Jesus Lord by, beyond mans spirit, by which the holy mens words are seen, which they spak as they were mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the holy Ghost, but ye can not believe that there are any holy men now adays, nor hardly believe them that were so in the Apostles days, nor before: and those Scripturs which the holy men spak forth as they were moved by the holy Ghost, and came not by the will of men, ye men in your own wills, quarrel; jangl and disput about, and are so wilfull against others that witness the holy Ghost, and are run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sects, and one against another, and are not in fellowship, for how should ye that are out of the holy Ghost, be in the fellowship of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</p>
            <p>And <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>For we which have believed do enter into rest</hi> (marke, <hi>into rest</hi>) <hi>and he that hath entered into rest hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his:</hi> and so not to be saved by their own works, when they are ceased from them.</p>
            <p>Now if all they, that are called <hi>Christians,</hi> were the true believers in the Light, as Christ the LIGHT commands, they would enter into him their rest and be children of the LIGHT, and cease from their own works, as GOD did from his, but unbelief shuts out, for they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in, because of unbelief, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. And the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1:15. <hi>For our Gospell unto you was not in word onely, but in power and in the holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if your Gospel be not in power and in the holy Ghost, but
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44863:39"/>onely in word; how should we receive it, or you? For the <hi>Gospel is the Power of God,</hi> and if ye have not the same Gospel which the Apostles had, which Gospel is the Power of God, then have ye not the Gospel of God: for ye say, ye have not the same power, then ye have not the same Gospel, then marke your portion as the Apostle tells you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1:8. And the Apostle saith <hi>We approve our selves to every mans conscience in the sight of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 4:2. So it's the duty of every one that declares the Gospel, and that has received it, to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to every mans conscience, as the Apostles did. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles doctrin was not <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay:</hi> but hath not yours been <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay?</hi> Is it not <hi>yea</hi> in the time of a sun-shine, and <hi>nay</hi> in the time of a storme? And if it was not <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay,</hi> how come ye to turn from one Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to another so often? But we know the <hi>Gospel</hi> is <hi>yea,</hi> and not <hi>nay;</hi> and <hi>all the Promises of God are yea in him,</hi> to wit, Christ; <hi>are yea and Amen</hi> to the glory of God, and it is God which stablisheth us in Christ, where all the Saints are established: and hath anoynted us and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed us, who hath also <hi>sealed us</hi> (marke, sealed us) <hi>with the Spirit of promise, and hath given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts,</hi> (marke, the earnest of his Spirit in our hearts) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us,</hi> (marke, in us) <hi>so our consolations abound through Christ:</hi> and this we are sensible of, and all our mercy, peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort comes from him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ in them that are saved, and in them that perish, to the one we are the savour of death unto death, and to the other the savour of life unto life,</hi> 2 Cor. 15:16. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:14. <hi>We know that we are translated from death to life,</hi> (marke, are translat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>because we love the Brethren: and he that loveth not his Brother abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in death, and he that saith, he remaineth in him,</hi> to wit, Christ, <hi>he ought so to walk, as he hath walked,</hi> 1 Joh. 26. <hi>For as he is</hi> [to wit, Christ] (saith John) <hi>even so are we in this world.</hi> 1 Joh. 4:17. And now would not ye Professors of the Letter say, they blasphemed to say, that as Christ was, so were they in this present world? Ye that profess him, and do not possess him, are not ye such? For they that said, they were Jewes and were not, (but the Synagogue of Satan) did not they lye and blaspheme? And are not they such that profess themselves Christians but are not, but in name onely? <hi>For he is a Iew that is one inward: and the circumcision in the heart and in the spirit, not in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44863:39"/>whose praise is of God and not of man.</hi> And so is not he a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian that is one inward in the heart, in the spirit, whose praise is not of men, but of God? <hi>Rom.</hi> 2:29. And the Apostle saith, <hi>Seing that ye have put off the old man with his works, and have put on the New man, which is renewed in knowledg after the image of him that created him.</hi> Mark, ye Professors and others, that plead for your old man to the grave, here the old man was put off, and the new man put on, before they went to the grave, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3:8. And <hi>Iohn the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist,</hi> who was a man sent from God, that came for a Witness to <hi>bear witness of the LIGHT,</hi> said, <hi>he was not that Light,</hi> but <hi>this Light was the Life in the WORD,</hi> and the <hi>Light in men, and this Light shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not; and that was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> Joh 1.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1:26, 27. he saith, <hi>but there is standing one among you, whom ye know not,</hi> (speaking of Christ) <hi>he it is that cometh after me, which was preferred before me.</hi> And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1:15. bearing witness of Christ, he cryed, saying, <hi>this is he of whom I said, he that cometh after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.</hi> Mark, before John, though as to his birth he came after him, but Christ was before John was, for <hi>all things that were made, were made by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:12, 13. where ye may hear Christs own words, <hi>If when I tell you Earthly things ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you of Heavenly things? For no man ascended up into heaven, but he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven,</hi> mark, <hi>in heaven.</hi> And further <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>he that hath the bride, is the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him, rejoyceth greatly, because of the bridegrooms voyce. He that is from on high is above all,</hi> to wit, Christ, <hi>he is not of the Earth;</hi> how can ye give him then that by-name <hi>humane,</hi> when John saith, he is not of the Earth? Mark, <hi>of the Earth,</hi> for John saith, <hi>he that is of the Earth, is of the Earth, and speaks of the Earth; he that is come from heaven is above all, and what he hath heard and seen that he testifys, but no man receiveth his Testimony, he that receiveth his Tistimony hath set to his seal that God is true,</hi> Joh. 3.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5:20. &amp;c. <hi>For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all judgment to the Son,</hi> because that all men should honour the Son, as they honour the Father, for he that honoureth not the Son, the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44863:40"/>same honoureth not the Father that sent the Son. Mark, all men should honour the Son, for <hi>he dyed for all men,</hi> and <hi>is the Saviour of all men,</hi> especially of them that believe, and <hi>inlightens all men,</hi> and <hi>his Grace hath appeared to all men,</hi> to believe in and to teach them, which we are witnesses of, and testify unto. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5:24. <hi>Verily, verily I say unto you, he that heareth my Word, and believeth in him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but hath passed from death to life.</hi> Mark, <hi>hath,</hi> then he is passed from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of death and sin: and this we witness. And again, <hi>Verily, Verily,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>I say unto you, the hour shall come and now is,</hi> (mark, <hi>now is</hi>) <hi>when the dead shall hear the voyce of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. Marvell not at this, for the hour shall come,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voyce, and they shall come forth, that have done good, to the resurrection of Life; but they that have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.</hi> So mark your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for it is not a serving of God with your lips, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. but ye must be rewarded according to your doings,</p>
            <p>And further Christ saith, <hi>Iohn bore witness of me,</hi> to wit, the Light. But have not your Professors born witness against this Light, and call it <hi>natural</hi> and an <hi>idol,</hi> as <hi>Robert Brown</hi> a Baptist Teacher in <hi>Worchester</hi> called it, to <hi>Samuel Morley?</hi> Which gives <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> the lye, who said, it was the <hi>Life in Christ and Light in men,</hi> which we bear witness to. And Christ saith, the <hi>Father himself which hath sent me, beareth witness of me, and ye have not heard his voyce at any time, nor seen his shape:</hi> and these were great Letter-Professors. And Christ saith to <hi>Philipp,</hi> Joh. 14:2. <hi>He that hath seen me hath seen my Father: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me,</hi> and <hi>the words that I speak unto you, I speak not of my self, but the Father that dwelleth in me doth the works.</hi> So they that see not the Son, see not the Father, and they that see the Son, see the Father. And if any man doth his will, to wit, Christs, he shall know his doctrin: so they that do not Christs will, do not know his doctrin, though they may talk of it, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7:17. And Christ saith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. <hi>The bread of God is he which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth life unto the world.

Therefore every man that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh to me.</hi> Mark, that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh to the Son, which we witness. And Christ saith, <hi>This is the true bread which cometh down from heaven, he that eateth of it shall not dye,</hi> and <hi>I am the living Bread which came down from heaven,</hi> saith Christ. And <hi>if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever.</hi> So it's not onely talking of Christ, but eating and feeding of his flesh. <hi>For the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> And this we witness to be our bread, and have eaten of it, and therefore must needs owne this flesh of Christ to be our heavenly bread, which comes down from heaven, and can not deny our food, our daily bread.</p>
            <p>Then the Letter-professing Jewes murmured again, and said, <hi>How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</hi> Then said Jesus unto them, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> And this is our daily drink and daily food, the flesh and blood of him that comes from heaven.

               <hi>he that eateth me even he shall live by me.</hi> So its clear there is no living by Christ, and no dwelling in Christ and he in him, without eating his flesh and drinking his blood which came down from heaven: <hi>and he that eateth this bread liveth for ever.</hi> So ye must all come to eat and drink of this food, and praise God which will bring all into Life and Peace.</p>
            <p>Then some of the Disciples murmured as wel as the Jewes at this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he said unto them, <hi>What then if ye should see the Son of Man</hi> (mark, Son of Man) <hi>ascend up where he was before?</hi> (Mark, where he was before) And then Christ interprets his own words, and saith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the twelve, <hi>Will ye go away also?</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>Master, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall we goe?

            <p>And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8:23. Jesus said unto the Jewes, <hi>Ye are from beneath, I am from above: ye are of this world, I am not of this world;</hi> and <hi>ye nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know me nor my Father, if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also,</hi> ver. 19.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Except ye believe that I am he,</hi> to wit, the Christ, <hi>ye shall dye in your sins.</hi> And Jesus said unto them, <hi>when ye have lift up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and doe nothing of my self, but as my Father hath taught me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. the Jewes said unto Christ, <hi>Thou art not yet</hi> 40 <hi>years old, and how hast thou seen Abraham?</hi> Here they looked upon him carnally, and Jesus said unto them, <hi>Ʋerily, verily I say unto you, before Abraham was I am,</hi> then <hi>the Iewes took up stones to cast at him,</hi> and said <hi>he had a devil.</hi> Here the devil got up in them that neither knew Christs birth, nor as he was before Abraham. This is like our Letter-Professing spirit, that stoneth him where he is manifest in his people, and calls his Light an <hi>idol,</hi> and saith it is of the devil. So the Professors now blaspheme his Life the Light, as the Iewes blasphemed him in the days of his flesh.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. Jesus saith, <hi>I am the door of the sheep.</hi> And again, <hi>I am the door, by me if any man enter he shall be saved, and shall go in and out and shall find pastur.</hi> So there is no entering in nor out to this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stur but by Christ the door, the thief cometh not but to steal, kill and destroy. Mark, <hi>ye that steal the word from your neighbour,</hi> and such are killers and destroyers. But <hi>I am come,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>that ye might have Life, and have it aboundantly.

And this set the Jewes a murmuring again: but this power we witness Christ hath. And he saith <hi>the hireling will flee, because he is an hireling:</hi> which your actions sufficiently manifest.

            <p>And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12:26. Jesus said, <hi>If any man serve me let him follow me,</hi> (mark, he must follow Christ) <hi>for where I am, there shall also my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant be, and if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.</hi>

            <p>CHRIST is called the <hi>MESSIAH,</hi> Joh. 1:41. which <hi>Messiah</hi> by interpretation is <hi>Christ.</hi> And the Angels said unto them that sought Jesus, after he was risen, <hi>VVhy seek ye the living among the dead?</hi> when they came to look for him in the sepulchre. Moreover the Angel said, <hi>he is not here but is risen: remember how he spake unto you, when he was yet in Galilee saying, that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinfull men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again; and they remembred his words,</hi> Luk 24:6, 7. Matth. 17:23. Mark 9:31.</p>
            <p>And <hi>he</hi> was a <hi>Prophet Mighty in deed and in word, before God and all the people: but the high Priests and Rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</hi> Here ye may see, the chief Priests had a hand in it.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Matth.</hi> 26:24. Christ saith, <hi>Surely the Son of man goeth his way, as it is written of him, but wo be unto that man, by whom the Son of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man if he had never been born.</hi> So it was the Son of man that was betrayed and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, not as he was God: and he that was betrayed and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, to wit, the Son of man, is he that is risen.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6:62. Christ said, <hi>VVhat then if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?</hi> Mark, the Son of man.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13:31, 32. When Judas, that betrayed him, was gone out from him, <hi>Iesus said, Now is the Son of man glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and God is glorified in him, if God be glorified in him, God shall glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</hi>

            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:44863:44"/>
            <p>And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3:13. Christ saith, <hi>but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man, which is in heaven.</hi> And this we believe, though ye have given him other names, as <hi>humane body,</hi> or <hi>humanity,</hi> which names are not found in Scripture; neither is he called by such names by God or Christ, or his Apostles; but he is called the <hi>MESSIAH,</hi> the <hi>IMMANVEL,</hi> the <hi>Son of man,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Thing,</hi> and the <hi>VVORD of God,</hi> and the <hi>Amen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3:14. But where in Scriptur can we find such names, as <hi>humane body</hi> and <hi>humanity</hi> given to Christ? And Christ, as ye say, is in heaven with a carnal body: and so we can not believe you further, then ye give forth Scriptur for your names and termes that ye give to Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. Christ, after he was risen, saith, <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> &amp;c. [mark] And this we believe of him, for he hath manifested himself <hi>in us</hi> by his <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> who was crucified without the gates at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and was buryed and rose the third day, and is at the right hand of God, and said unto his Disciples, he would <hi>come again unto</hi> them, and <hi>dwell in</hi> them: and this we witness, that he <hi>dwelt in</hi> his Saints, and <hi>in us</hi> his people; and hath made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, as before. And those ages are come that the Apostles declared of, (Glory to GOD!) and we can say, Glory to God through Jesus Christ for ever, who was set up from everlasting to everlasting, who is the <hi>Rock of ages,</hi> yea <hi>our Rock</hi> in our age, who is the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many generations,</hi> yea <hi>our Foundation</hi> in our generation, who is <hi>our chief Corner-ston,</hi> by which we stand against all the foul weather and storms of tho Professors and profane; who is <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>Precious,</hi> who is the <hi>First and Last,</hi> who <hi>bruiseth the Serpents head</hi> that led man into transgression from God, and <hi>Christ</hi> it is who leads man again unto God.

Come therefore, let us sing the song of <hi>Moses</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> which none can learn but they that are redeemed from the Earth: for we know our Beloved and we have found him when we pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the watchmen of the night, who smot us, and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us: So we can say <hi>My beloved is mine and I am his.</hi> He hath knockt at the door of our hearts, and we have let him in, and he is come to supp with us, and we with him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3:20. of the spiritual and heavenly Supper at the Table of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is above the table of Devils out of the Truth; Glory to God for ever. <hi>Amen. Halelu-IAH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further concerning what the Angels said of Christ to <hi>Mary.</hi> The Angel answered and said unto Mary, <hi>The
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44863:46"/>Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the Power of the Most High shall overshaddow thee,</hi> therefore also <hi>that Holy Thing that shall be born of thee, shall be called The SON of GOD,</hi> Luk 1:35.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And Ioseph of Arimathea went to Pilat and asked of him the body of IESVS.</hi> Now Joseph did not ask for the <hi>Humane</hi> body of Jesus, or give it such a name, as may be seen in the Evangelists, and no where did they give him such names, as <hi>Humane body</hi> nor <hi>Humanity,</hi> which names ye have added to him more then the Scripturs do.</p>
            <p>And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. the Apostle saith, <hi>He that eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unworthily, eateth and drinketh his own damnation, because he discerns not the Lords body.</hi> Now what say ye to this, ye that call his body <hi>Humane?</hi> May not every unworthy eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er see and discern that which is Humane?</p>
            <p>And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>They did all eat of the same spirituall meat, and drink of the same spiritual drink, for they drank of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ROCK, that followed them, and that ROCK was CHRIST.</hi> So is not Christ called a <hi>SPIRITVAL ROCK,</hi> and was not this before he was born of a Virgin?</p>
            <p>And further he saith, <hi>God was not wel pleased with many of them, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Christ saith, <hi>I am the Resurrection and the Life: He that believeth in me</hi> though <hi>he were dead yet shall he live.</hi> And <hi>VVhosoever</hi> liveth and <hi>believeth in me shall never dye.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ye this ye Professors, as <hi>Mary</hi> did?</p>
            <p>And ye make a great deal ado concerning what bodys people shall be raised, and about the body of Christ; therefore be satisfied with the Apostles doctrin: for the Apostle saith, <hi>Some men will say How are the dead raised, and with what bodys shall they come forth?</hi> And therefore he saith, <hi>Awake to live righteously, and sin not: for some have not the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44863:47"/>knowledg of God, I speak this to your shame.</hi> Therefore see, Is not this your condition, that make such a work about the body of Christ, and with what bodys people shall be raised up: and the Apostle saith to such, <hi>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it dye, and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be.</hi> So he tells here plainly it is not the same, and calls thee a fool that sayest it is the same; if thou sowest wheat or other corn, let the husbandman answer thee in this.</p>
            <p>Further the Apostle tells thee, <hi>God giveth it a body as pleaseth him, and to every seed its own body.</hi> And therefore people are to wait upon God to give it a body as pleaseth him: and the Apostle tells thee, there are also <hi>Heavenly bodys</hi> and there are <hi>Earthly bodys, but the glory of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is one, and the glory of the Earthly is another, so also is the resurrection of the body.</hi> (Mark, can ye read people here?) He further tells you, <hi>it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</hi> And of the Heavenly bodys and Earthly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, this Heavenly is not Earthly: Is it? <hi>It's sown a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body and raised a spiritual body,</hi> and there is <hi>a natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and there is <hi>a spiritual body.</hi> So is Natural Spiritual? As it is also written, <hi>The first man was made a Living Soul, and the Last a QVICKENING SPIRIT,</hi> to wit, Christ. (mark, made a quickening Spirit) Howbeit that was not first made, which is spiritual; but that which is natural, and afterward that which is Spiritual. Can not ye read this? Are not ye awake? Doth not the Apostle bid you awake, that ye may read and see? <hi>The first man is of the Earth, Earthly;</hi> (mark, the first man) <hi>the Second Man is the LORD from Heaven.</hi> Mark, the Second Man, to wit, CHRIST.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:44863:47"/>
            <p>And is the first man humane, and the Second Man the Lord from Heaven humane also? Will ye give them both the name <hi>Humane?</hi> Where had ye such words to call the Second Man withall? Not from the Scriptures, for they give him no such by-names.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle further tells you, <hi>As is the Earthly, such are the Earthly</hi> (like it self, and will call other things like it self) <hi>and as is the Heavenly, such are they also that are Heavenly,</hi> like its self again: <hi>And as we have born the image of the Earthly</hi> [mark] <hi>so shall we bear the image of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> And can the Apostle express himself in more plaine words?</p>
            <p>So here is an image of the Earthly, and an image of the Heavenly; these are two bodys, and two images, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Heavenly: So wel might the Apostle say, <hi>Thou Fool:</hi> for an Heavenly image is not an Earthly, a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual body is not a Natural, nor an Heavenly body an Earthly. So thou fool, <hi>that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be.</hi> Mark, that shall be.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle saith, <hi>At the last Trumpet the Dead shall be raised up incorruptible,</hi> [mark, <hi>incorruptible] and we shall be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.</hi> And that is a quick change: and do not the fools say, they shall not be changed, but must be raised with the corruptible, the same?</p>
            <p>And further 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2:15. the Apostle saith, <hi>this corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible must put on incorruption, neither doth corruption inherit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption,</hi> (so it is not the same) <hi>and this mortal must put on immortality.</hi> So it is not the same. <hi>And when this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible hath put on incorruption, and this mortality hath put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass this saying that is written,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44863:48"/>Death is swallowed up in victory. O Death where is thy sting? O Grave where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the LAVV.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Grave hath not victory over immortality, and that is over the sting of death. <hi>But thanks be unto God, which hath given us the victory through our LORD Iesus Christ.</hi> And this we witness, and believe what the Apostle saith.</p>
            <p>And the Apostle further saith, <hi>Behold I will shew you a mystery, VVe shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed.</hi> (mark, be changed) So then not the same: which the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will teach thee.</p>
            <p>Moreover, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3:20. the Apostle saith, <hi>But our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is in Heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, even our Lord Iesus Christ, who shall change</hi> (mark, then it is not the same) <hi>our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his Glorious Body.</hi> So if the vile body be changed and fashioned like unto his glorious body, it is not the same, and consequently do not ye undervalue the Lord JESUS CHRIST and his body, ye that are giving such by-names to his body, as <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Humanity?</hi> Yea some have been so bold as to say he is in Heaven with a natural and carnal body, but these have been some of the grossest sort of Professors. And the greatest sort of Professors say, he is in heaven with a humane body. But these are not Scriptur terms or names, for if your vile natural and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodys must be changed, and made like unto his glorious body, then how can ye say that Christ is in Heaven with a carnal, natural, or humane body? For <hi>[Natural] knowes not the things of God,</hi> and <hi>[Carnal] is sold under sin,</hi> as the Apostle tells you. And is not Humane from the ground? But doth not Christ say, he is from above?
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44863:48"/>The second man is the Lord from Heaven, and his body is a GLORIOUS BODY, and <hi>he</hi> is the HEAVENLY, SPIRITUAL MAN. Therefore all that profess Scriptures and Christianity, let them keep to Scripture terms, and to those names, which God and Christ and the Holy men of God in Scriptur have given to it and him, which are sound words not to be condemned.</p>
